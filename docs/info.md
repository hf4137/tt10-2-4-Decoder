## How it works

The 2-to-4 line binary decoder consists of an array of four AND 
gates. The 2 binary inputs labelled A and B are decoded into one 
of 4 outputs, hence the description of 2-to-4 binary decoder. 
Each output represents one of the minterms of the 2 input 
variables, (each output = a minterm). There is an enable signal, 
E, which dictates whether all outputs are 1, or a specific output 
(based on the inputs) is coded as 0. 

## How to test

You test it by running all possible inputs and checking if the 
outputs match the expected values. Refer to the truth table of an 
active-high logic 2-4 decoder below. 

When E=1 -> D[3:0]=1 

| E | A | B | D3 | D2 | D1 | D0 | 
|---|---|---|----|----|----|----| 
| 0 | 0 | 0 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  0 | 
| 1 | 0 | 0 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 | 
| 0 | 0 | 1 |  1 |  1 |  0 |  1 | 
| 1 | 0 | 1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 | 
| 0 | 1 | 0 |  1 |  0 |  1 |  1 | 
| 1 | 1 | 0 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 | 
| 0 | 1 | 1 |  0 |  1 |  1 |  1 | 
| 1 | 1 | 1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |
